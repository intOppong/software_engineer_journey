# Tutorials Projects


A **Tutorial Project** is just what it is -- a project based tutorial like "Create Tic Tac Toe with HTML, CSS & Javascript"

The sole Purpose of Tutorial Projects is to:
* Clarify specific skills to focus on for my next project from the [guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md).
* See the skill in action. 

Below is a list of Tutorial Projects I used as practice before doing the actual Project from the [guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md).

**NOTE** 
* I based the selection of Tutorial Projects on the projects listed in the guide.
