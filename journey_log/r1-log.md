# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: setup the project file structure & working on passport's google Oauth strategy.

**Thoughts:** Setting up passport is challening but cool when you understand the auth flow/process.

### Day 2: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented google strategy from passport & setup the development database

**Thoughts:** There's not a lot of resources to lookup issues related with passport. Or maybe I'm not a google ninga yet :smile:

### Day 4: November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: reading [definitive nodeJS handbook](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-definitive-node-js-handbook-6912378afc6e). testing my redux setup but this bugging CORS error remains.

**Thoughts:** Been struggling with understanding the redux flow. mapDispatchToProps gave me hell today. Spent the whole time fixing redux errors & now I have to deal with more errors.
