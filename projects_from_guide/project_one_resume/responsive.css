  * media Type: all, screen, print, tv, and braille
  *   - default: screen;
  * logical operators in media queries: if they are true styles are applied & vice versa
  *   - attr: and, not, only
  *   - The only logical operator is a new operator and is not recognized by user agents using the
  *     HTML4 algorithm
  *   - not & only: when media type is avoided, it defaults to "all"
  * Media Features:
  *   - attr: width, height, orientation, color etc
  *   - width & height features are based off the height and width of the viewport rendering area
  *   - orientation: landscape or portrait
  *     - The landscape mode is triggered when the display is wider than taller, and the portrait
  *       mode is triggered when the display is taller than wider
