## The Guide
I’m using [P1xt’s](https://github.com/P1xt) [Computer Science & Web Development Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides#computer-science-and-web-development---comprehensive). My goal is to be a software engineer with good web development skills. I want to focus on the Backend with basic Fornt-End knowledge. So this guide is well suited for my needs. I’m grateful to P1xt for curating such an overarching project oriented guide. Your work, to us aspiring Developers is truly invaluable. God Bless You.

I know there’s a lot of aspiring [developers](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/computer-deprecated-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516) who are in need of a structure like this, so I’m not gonna taking this journey lightly. I hope to complete the guide in a 18months or less. I understand it’s very hard but i’m dedicated & have structured my time for the long run to complete this guide. I’m Committed to see it through.
*Commitment implies you know there will be times when you feel like you made the wrong decision, when you want to give up cos it’s too damn difficult than you ever anticipated. But you are going to do it anyway because that is what you want & there’s nothing better else to do that’ll make you happier.*

## My Goal
As stated above, I want to be an elite software engineer with good web dev skills. I define a Software Engineer as a programmer with the ability to Architect, Develop, Test & Maintain Libraries, Frameworks or Platforms that is used by developers to automatic some task or assist them in developing their applications. 
* Result Oriented: *the outcome*
    * Finish the Guide in 18 months - Dec 2017 -> May 2019
        * Outstretched: Finish the Guide in a Year - Dec 2017 -> Nov 2018
    * Front-End: My goal for front-End is to understand the crucial topics & concepts & leave the specifics to designers. With that in mind my goals for studying the various technologies are as follows.
        * HTML: understand how to create a fully Semantic complaint HTML code
        * CSS: understand how measurements work. Page Layouts, Grids, Responsive Design and their likes.
        * Javascript for Frontend: TBD
    * Backend: TBD
    * Algorithm: TBD
    * System Design: TBD
* Process Oriented: *how the results should occurs. how to go about it*
    * Work Everyday averaging 10 Pomodoros a day & at least 5 Pomodoros on days where life duties call (eg: going to the hospital, helping family with work etc).
        * *Pomodoro settings is 30mins work, max of 10mins break.*
    * Stay Disciplined, Stay Focused, Stay Patient & Stay Positive
* What’s Important
    * **Build all the projects in the guide.**
    * **Deeply Understand Concepts.**
    * **Helping Others on Forums (FCC, cohorts)**
    * **Collaborating with others on projects (FCC, cohort)**
    * **Writing about my journey**
    
## How I'll Use the [Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md)
I don’t like reading book/course after book/course without working on projects. I like to study alongside a project. I’m able to identify specific skills that I should learn. Also learning the skill becomes more interesting because I’m actually using the skill + there’s a lot of AHA moments :bulb:
> Its usually not important to learn sth that you won’t use in the near future. I feel more motivated to learn sth, knowing I’ll be needing it now.

With that said I came up with a strategy that i think best suits my preference & priorities rather than to follow the guide chronologically.

1. Identify the next project listed in the guide.
   * List the Skills required to do that project. *if you already know the skill, Skip to 5) & do the project*
2. Find a **[Tutorial Project](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/master/tutorial_projects)** of similar difficulty to the given project. *a Tutorial Project: is just a project based tutorial like "Create a Tic Tac Toe game with HTML, CSS & Javascript"* 
3. Follow the Tutorial Project. 
   * List (clarify) specific skills You’ll need to learn to do the project.
   * List other skills unrelated to the project in a backlog.
3. Learn the specific skills. *Learn just enough to get started*
4. Do the Project
   * If you need to learn or sharpen any skill to do the project, learn it as you do the project. 
5. Work on bugs
6. write project readme
7. Learn stuff you need to expand understanding on.
