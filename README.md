## The Guide
I’m using [P1xt’s](https://github.com/P1xt) [Computer Science & Web Development Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides#computer-science-and-web-development---comprehensive). My goal is to be a software engineer with good web development skills. So this guide is well suited for my needs. I’m grateful to P1xt for curating such an overarching project oriented guide. Your work, to us aspiring Developers is truly invaluable. God Bless You.

I know there’s a lot of aspiring [developers](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/computer-deprecated-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516) who are in need of a structure like this, so I’m not gonna taking this journey lightly. I hope to complete the guide in a 18months or less. I understand it’s very hard but i’m dedicated & have structured my time for the long run to complete this guide. I’m Committed to see it through.
*Commitment implies you know there will be times when you feel like you made the wrong decision, when you want to give up cos it’s too damn difficult than you ever anticipated. But you are going to do it anyway because that is what you want & there’s nothing better else to do that’ll make you happier.*
