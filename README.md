## The Guide
I’m using [P1xt’s](https://github.com/P1xt) [Computer Science & Web Development Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides#computer-science-and-web-development---comprehensive). My goal is to be a software engineer with good web development skills. I want to focus on the Backend with basic Fornt-End knowledge. So this guide is well suited for my needs. I’m grateful to P1xt for curating such an overarching project oriented guide. Your work, to us aspiring Developers is truly invaluable. God Bless You.

I know there’s a lot of aspiring [developers](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/computer-deprecated-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516) who are in need of a structure like this, so I’m not gonna taking this journey lightly. I hope to complete the guide in a 18months or less. I understand it’s very hard but i’m dedicated & have structured my time for the long run to complete this guide. I’m Committed to see it through.
*Commitment implies you know there will be times when you feel like you made the wrong decision, when you want to give up cos it’s too damn difficult than you ever anticipated. But you are going to do it anyway because that is what you want & there’s nothing better else to do that’ll make you happier.*

## My Goal
As stated above, I want to be an elite software engineer with good web dev skills. I define a Software Engineer as a programmer with the ability to Architect, Develop, Test & Maintain Libraries, Frameworks or Platforms that is used by developers to automatic some task or assist them in developing their applications. 
* Result Oriented: *the outcome*
    * Finish the Guide in 18 months - Dec 2017 -> May 2019
        * Outstretched: Finish the Guide in a Year - Dec 2017 -> Nov 2018
    * Front-End: My goal for front-End is to understand the crucial topics & concepts & leave the specifics to designers. With that in mind my goals for studying the various technologies are as follows.
        * HTML: understand how to create a fully Semantic complaint HTML code
        * CSS: understand how measurements work. Page Layouts, Grids, Responsive Design and their likes.
        * Javascript for Frontend: TBD
    * Backend: TBD
    * Algorithm: TBD
    * System Design: TBD
* Process Oriented: *how the results should occurs. how to go about it*
    * Work Everyday averaging 10 Pomodoros a day & at least 5 Pomodoros on days where life duties call (eg: going to the hospital, helping family with work etc).
        * *Pomodoro settings is 30mins work, max of 10mins break.*
    * Stay Disciplined, Stay Focused, Stay Patient & Stay Positive
* What’s Important
    * **Build all the projects in the guide.**
    * **Deeply Understand Concepts.**
    * **Helping Others on Forums (FCC, cohorts)**
    * **Collaborating with others on projects (FCC, cohort)**
    * **Writing about my journey**
    
## How I'll Use the [Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md)
I don’t like reading book/course after book/course without working on projects. I like to study alongside a project. I’m able to identify specific skills that I should learn. Also learning the skill becomes more interesting because I’m actually using the skill + there’s a lot of AHA moments :bulb:
> Its usually not important to learn sth that you won’t use in the near future. I feel more motivated to learn sth, knowing I’ll be needing it now.

With that said I came up with a strategy that i think best suits my preference & priorities rather than to follow the guide chronologically.

1. Identify at the next project listed in the guide
   * *Look @ the description (or a finished version) & List(predict) the Skills required to do that project.*
   * *if you already know the skill, Skip to 4) & do the project*
2. Find a **[Tutorial Project](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/master/tutorial_projects)** of similar difficulty & follow it.
   * List (clarify) specific skills You’ll need to learn to do the project.
   * List new skills unrelated to the project in a backlog.
3. Learn the specific skills. *just enough to get started*
4. Do the Project in the guide.
   * If I need to learn/know a specific skill to perform some task in the project, learn just enough to do the task.
5. Work on bugs
6. write project readme
7. After the Project, Spend time to deeply understand (Learn) the skills used in the project.

   ### Illustration

1. Project from guide: Tower of Hanoi Solver
  * Skills Required:
    * Javascript - programming Logic
    * Animation - CSS Transition & Transform
    * HTML & CSS - basic web page
2. Find a Tutorial Project & follow it: Snake Game - Youtube, HTML5 animation - Youtube
  * Clarify skills you need to learn:
    * Javascript - programming Logic.
    * HTML5 canvas & Javascript - animation.
    * DOM manipulation using Javascript.
  * List new skills unrealted to the project in a backlog
3. Learn the skills; just enough to get started
4. Do the Project: 
  * Skills needed to do specific tasks
    * Callbacks & Async: to make sure functions in the correct order
5. Work on bugs
6. After Project: Skills to Expand Knowledge on
  * working with branches on git/github: i want to work in a temporary branch then merge it to the master branch when it’s bug
  “free” (main repo) when complete
  * Working with the DOM - DOM manipulation
  * Debugging using google dev environment
  * Async & Callbacks: YDKJS: Async & Performance
  * Follow 1 or 2 more canvas Animation tutorials
