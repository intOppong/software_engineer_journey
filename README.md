# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

## NOTE

*NOTE: I’m switching from [P1xt’s](https://github.com/P1xt) [Computer Science & Web Development Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides#computer-science-and-web-development---comprehensive) to [FCC’s guide](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). I feel FCC is suits me better. Also I just need a new spark after months on inconsistency. I hope this creates a new & sustained drive.*

## The Guide
I’m using [FreeCodeCamps Curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and [P1xt’s Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides#computer-science-and-web-development---comprehensive) as backup. I’m going to do all FCC’s projects using my method of learning detailed below. FreeCodeCamp has a huge community of people willing to assist whenever you get stuck. That’s a huge plus for me. This journey is not easy and you’ll often need encouragement from the community. 

P1xt guide will serve as a referral source for books & courses and also other projects i might be interested in.

## My Goal
My goal is to be a software engineer. I define a Software Engineer as a programmer with the ability to Architect, Develop, Test & Maintain Libraries, Frameworks or Platforms that is used by developers to automatic some task or assist them in developing their applications. I like the Backend and i like Architecture.
* Result Oriented: *the outcome*
    * Front-End: I want to have basic frontend skills to enable be create quick prototypes / make a quick MVP [like this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-built-the-airbnb-of-music-studios-in-an-evening-part-1-742b47bc09c2). As stated above I want to focus on the backend & leave the design to more competent people.
    * Backend: TBD
    * Algorithm: TBD
    * System Design: TBD
* Process Oriented: *how the results should occurs. how to go about it*
  * Work Everyday averaging 13 Pomodoros a day & 10 Pomodoros on days where life duties call (eg: going to the bank, helping family with work etc)
    * *Pomodoro settings is 30mins work, max of 10mins break.*
* What’s Important
  * **Build all FCC projects.**
  * **Deeply Understand Concepts.**
  * **Helping Others on Forums (FCC, cohorts)**
  * **Collaborating with others on projects (FCC, cohort)**
  * **Writing about my journey**
    
## How I Learn
I don’t like reading book/course after book/course without working on projects. I like to study alongside a project. I’m able to identify specific skills that I should learn. Also learning the skill becomes more interesting because I’m actually using the skill + there’s a lot of AHA moments :bulb:
> Its usually not important to learn something that you won’t use in the near future. I feel more motivated to learn a skill knowing I’ll be needing it now.

1. Identify the next project listed in the guide
   * *Look @ the description (or a finished version) & List(predict) the Skills required to do that project.*
   * *if you already know the skill, Skip to 4) & do the project*
2. Find a **[Tutorial Project](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/master/tutorial_projects)** of similar difficulty & follow it.
   * List (clarify) specific skills You’ll need to learn to do the project.
   * List new skills unrelated to the project in a backlog.
3. Learn the specific skills. *just enough to get started*
4. Do the Project in the guide.
   * If I need to learn/know a specific skill to perform some task in the project, learn just enough to do the task.
5. Work on bugs
6. write project readme
7. After the Project, Spend time to deeply understand (Learn) the skills used in the project.

   ### Illustration
1. Project from guide: Tower of Hanoi Solver
	* Skills Required:
		* Javascript - programming Logic
		* Animation - CSS Transition & Transform
		* HTML & CSS - basic web page
2. Find a Tutorial Project & follow it: Snake Game - Youtube, HTML5 animation - Youtube
	* Clarify skills you need to learn:
		* Javascript - programming Logic.
		* HTML5 canvas & Javascript - animation.
		* DOM manipulation using Javascript.
	* List new skills unrealted to the project in a backlog
3. Learn the skills; just enough to get started
4. Do the Project: 
	* Skills needed to do specific tasks
		* Callbacks & Async: to make sure functions in the correct order
5. Work on bugs
6. After Project: Skills to Expand Knowledge on
	* working with branches on git/github: i want to work in a temporary branch then merge it to the master branch when it’s bug “free” (main repo) when complete
	* Working with the DOM - DOM manipulation
	* Debugging using google dev environment
	* Async & Callbacks: YDKJS: Async & Performance
	* Follow 1 or 2 more canvas Animation tutorials
