### August 2018 Overview
***
* August Didn't go as expected. 
* Week One: Mum was sick so I had to sit in for her at the shop everyday. But I know I had time in the evenings & early mornings to put in some pomodoro but I didn’t. _These are the times that will determine if i succeed (break in) or not_
* Week Two, Three & Four were awesome.
* week Five: Travelled & couldn't stick to routine when i returned.
* Moral Lessons
  * I have to do what I have to do to get what I want. Doing what I have to do makes me more happier than otherwise. Even though it sometimes "sucks" that’s life & it is what it is. Since you're going to do it no matter the mood, Accept that it's going to suck sometimes and choose to be happy & do it rather than feeling down & doing it because that will suck even more.
  * Eliminate judgement calls (ie on the spot decision making). You make/plan your schedule/routine & there's no discussing/debating it. If u make judgement calls, you’ll always make bad Decisions - Always. That’s how it works.

## Goals
***
**August 2018 run from 29th July to 1st September 2018. ie *"5 weeks"***

* Process Oriented Goals:
Work Everyday averaging 13 Pomodoros a day & 10 Pomodoros on days where life duties call (eg: going to the bank, helping 
family with work etc).

    | | No. of Working Days | Total Pomodoros | Average Pomodoro
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Full Days | 9 days | 152 | 16.8 |
    | Half Days | 6 days | 69 | 10.8 |
    | Total |  15 out of 24 days | 221 |  **9.2** |

### Week One
***
- What I Did
  - Finished a [Tutorial project](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/dev/tutorial_projects/socket-io-chat-app) on socket.io
  - Finished FCC sockets lectures: code working but tests failed.
  - Started doing FCC Information Security & Quality Assurance Projects: Metric-Imperial Converter
- What I Learnt
  - The socket.io process is basically about defining sockets at the server-side & client side to listen & emit data
  - Got introduced to keycodes associated with characters. example: Enter key === 13. [Link](https://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes)
  - passport.socketio: It's a module used to find out who’s connected to your web socket by making the authenticated `req.user` object available on the socket object as `socket.request.user.`
- Challenges
  - refer to information security & quality assurance projects [readme](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/dev/fcc_projects/information_security_and_quality_assurance/README.md) for more

### Week Two
***
- What i did:
  - Started & Finished FCC Project: Metric-Imperial Converter, Issue Tracker & Personal Library
  - Working on Stock Price Checker Project
- What I Learnt & Challenges
  - ref to FCC InfoSec Project [Readme](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/dev/fcc_projects/information_security_and_quality_assurance/README.md#personal-library)

### Week Three
***
- What i did:
  - Finsed FCC Projects: Stock Price Checker & Anonymous Message Board. Hence __*finished all of FCC's Information Security & Quality Assurance Projects*__
  - Found some nice subreddits to follow: [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/), [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/), [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/)
  - Found a very useful tool to search for information before even googling. [link](https://goalkicker.com/)
- What I Learnt & Challenges
  - ref to FCC: Infomation Security & Quality Assurance [README](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/dev/fcc_projects/information_security_and_quality_assurance/README.md)

### Week Four
***
- What I did
  - read mongodb node driver's docs on [CRUD](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/tutorials/crud/)
  - read mdn's doc on Javascript [Destructuring Assignments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
  - Started & Completed FCC Lectures on Regex.
- What I learnt
  - Multiple interesting ways to use Object Destructuring. Example: Nested Object & Array Destructuring
    ```javascript
      var people = [
        {name: 'Mike',family: [{mother: 'Jane',father: 'Harry',sister: 'Samantha'}],other: {age: 35}},
        {name: 'Tom',family: [{mother: 'Norah',father: 'Richard',brother: 'Howard'}],other: {age: 25}}
      ];
      
      for (var {name: n, family: [{father: f}], other: {age: a}} of people) {
        console.log('Name: ' + n + ', Age: ' + a + ', Father: ' + f);
      }
    ```
  - findAndModify(), findAndRemove & update() are deprecated from node Driver
  - Regular expressions just checks if the pattern is in the given string. It does not return the matched string if any. Use  `match()` to return the matched part of the string & `test()` to check if the pattern matched anything in our string.
  - Watched a regex tutorial on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa-TUpSx1JA)
  - Groups: 1) allow us to group several different character/patterns & match them as one
    ```javascript
      let str = 'https://www.google.com http://coreyms.com https://youtube.com https://www.nasa.gov'
       /https?:\/\/(www\.)?\w+\.\w+/  // The whole 'www.' is optional not just one character.
    ```
  - Capture Groups: allows us to capture & USE information from a group. each Captured group have numbers assigned to them.
    `\0` is the default & represents everything that was captured ie the entire match. `\1`, `\2` and so on represents each grouped pattern. The match() returns an array which contains all the groups in an array with their index corresponding to their group numbers.
    ```javascript
      let str = 'Camp Nou'
      let regex = /([a-zA-Z]+)\s([a-zA-Z]+)/
      str.match(regex)                        // [0: 'Camp Nou', 1: Camp, 2: Nou]
      str.replace(regex, '$2 $1')             // returns: Nou Camp
    ```
  - [Lookarounds (lookahead & lookbehind)](http://rexegg.com/regex-lookarounds.html): It's just an assertion that checks that a character or string follows, or precedes (exists) at a specific position in the string. Lookarounds does not match/return it - using match() on a regex of lookarounds will return an empty string. __NOTE: At the end of a lookaround, the regex engine hasn't moved on the string.__ Lookarounds can be arranged in any order. It doesn't matter which condition we check first. Example: This lookahead validates a password & matches it at the end.
    ``` javascript
     /^(?=\w{6,10}$)(?=[^a-z]*[a-z])(?=[^A-Z]*[A-Z]{3,})(?=\D*\d{1,})\w{6,10}/ 
       /*
       - The password must have between six and ten word characters. 
       - It must include at least one lowercase character
       - It must include at least three uppercase characters
       - It must include at least one digit
       */
    ```
- Challenges I faced
  - Don't understand why this destructuring code works. It wasn't in the mdn docs
    ```javascript
      const obj = { a: 5, b: 6, c: 7  };
      const picked = (({ a, c }) => ({ a, c }))(obj);
      console.log(picked); // { a: 5, c: 7 }
    ```
  - Does each pattern start the search from the beginning of the string or continue from where the last pattern found it's match.
