### December 2017 Overview
***
* Although i started following the Guide I think this month was mostly about figuring out how best to go about the guide, adjusting my Strategy and also my life style to better suit my new long term goal. There was a lot of adjustments going on. :confused: :grimacing: I'm I wrong?
* I setup myself for higher productivity in the coming months by coming up with a strategy that best suits my preference & priority.
* Little bit of inconsistencies at the beginning of the month.
* I overlooked other stuff like writing & keeping the Github repo updated. *it's time consuming but fun*
* Overall it was a good start.
* What to Improve upon
	* Focus exclusively on what's important.
	* Consistency. work everyday. this is key.

## December 2017 Goals

### Week One
***
* What I Did
    * basics of Git 
    * wrote a blog about the journey i'm undertaking.
* What I Learnt
    * new git commands such as init, config, clone, branch, push among others
    * git concepts such as branching, working area, Merge git mv & similarity index (ship of theusos philosophy) etc.
* Challenges I Faced
    * mv & similarity index was a little confusing.
    * rebase & reflog was confusing & i didn’t fully grasp their relevance.
    * difficulty expressing myself in writing.

### Week Two
***
* What I Did
    * started following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA) online tutorial project about Tetris but didn’t complete it.  *I decided to adjust my Strategy a bit so i don’t have to follow online tutorial projects which didn’t match the projects assigned by the guide*
    * completed a different online tutorial which focused on HTML & CSS - the skill i needed to learn at the moment. [resume tutorial project](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/master/tutorial_projects/resume)resume project tutorial. 
    * started [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) course from the [guide](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/master/cs_wd_progress.md)
* What I Learnt
    * learnt/revised HTML basics: structure, semantics.
    * learnt/revised CSS basics: Properties, selectors & specificity, reset, length values
* Challenges I Faced
    * Concerning the Tetris project tutorial: most of the skills used in this project is not what i'm learning at the moment. They're too advanced. What i need to do is find a project of similar difficulty to the one listed in the guide. I need to do easy stuff first.
    * I wasn’t consistent, i allowed life to get in the way. didn’t work at all from Thursday till the next week.
    
### Week Three
***
* What I Did
    * Completed [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) course from the [guide](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/master/cs_wd_progress.md)
    * Started working on the 1st project from the [guide](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/master/cs_wd_progress.md): [Clone this online Resume](https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots/#screenshot2). worked on the HTML Semantic Structure & CSS Grid System 
* What I Learnt & Challenges I Faced
    * I've detailed it in the project's [readme](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/master/projects_from_guide/project_one_resume) file.

### Week Four
***
* What I Did
    * Continue working on project one: bullet in resume section, circular progress bar, box shadow, icons in footer.
    * wrote my first readme for the project.
* What I Learnt & Challenges I Faced
    * I've detailed it in the project's [readme](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/master/projects_from_guide/project_one_resume) file.
    * a few handy markdown syntaxes
* How I Feel about Tools
    * Font awesome is awesome.

### Week Five
***
* What I Did
    * Setting up the repo for my SE journey & making changes to my approach to the guide. 
    * Started new course from guide. 
    * Started [Advanced HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/) course from the [guide](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/master/cs_wd_progress.md). I Completed 3 chapters but stopped because of changes to my approach to using the guide.
    * Came up with ways to set very clear goals. Got some tips from Scott Young’s [MIT Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLevjQIg-kYubWBFB8NN8EYvYjmJhjEzVA)
    * Copied [this](https://trello.com/b/4v9dpn3G/cs-wd-archived) trello board.
    * watched [cracking the code video on interviewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo) as suggested in the guide.
    * Started working on the 2nd project from the [guide](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/blob/master/cs_wd_progress.md): [Portfolio from the frontend section of FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)
* What I Learnt
    * How to architect/structure your website directory: OOSS & SMACSS. 
    * Better understanding of positioning. using absolute positioning offset properties to set width & height of an element without using the width/height properties. The Element will fill it's parent element leaving out the offsets as "margins". In the Example below, the height of <div> is the same as the <section> & it's width is 50% of the <section> width positioned at the right edge of the <section>
        ```html
		<section>
			<div”></div>
		</section>
		```
        ```css
        .div {
	        position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 50%;
            bottom: 0;
           }
        ```
    * All different background images are requested via HTTP so to reduce the http request use an image sprite where convenient. It works by
        * arranging common background images into a single image file (sprite).
        * add the sprite to the element using background image.
        * use background position property to show the correct background image for an element.
    * if properties are not overridden, they follow through to the next media query. they add up as usual. For Example
         ```css
            div {
              float: right
            }
            @media all and (min-width: 720px) {
              div {
                background: red;
                float: none;
              }
            }
            /* the div in the media query now becomes */
            div {
              background: red;
              float: none;
            }
        ```       
* Challenges I Faced
    * writing a well structured readme & setting up the directory for other programmers who might care is a longer process than i expected. Every detail matters. But it’s fun when you read & understand it from another person’s perspective.

### Week Six
***
* What I Did
    * Continue working on project two: css for the portfolio section.
        * I used a 12 col grid without defined margins for the site as a whole, but I turned to a 12 col grid with defined margins for the portfolio section. i.e. col-4 is 32%, but for the portfolio section col-4 is 31.33%, the rest is taken up by margin. 
        * found great techniques to [vertically center text/box](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8865458/how-do-i-vertically-center-text-with-css) in another element
* What I Learnt & Challenges I Faced
    * I've detailed it in the project's [readme](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/master/projects_from_guide/project_two_fcc_portfolio) file
    
### My Thoughts
***
* Concerning some of the git commands such as mv & similarity index, Reset, Reflog & Rebase, I was trying to understand concepts that I'll come across later when they become relevant. It's a waste of time. I should focus instead on learning the tools/skills needed to complete the given task.
* I should write more. Not confident in the sentences i write.
* Keep GitHub updated all the time
* I’m not an advocate for a specific method. I just adopt principles that makes common sense to me. This usually results in a mix of various methodologies. (OOCSS, SMACSS)
* I liked the idea of using sprites to reduce Http requests.
* I prefer the [mobile first approach](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/#mobile-first)
* I think it's better to structure your HTML for the bigger display, where every/most Content are visible then apply styles with mobile first in mind, hiding non-relevant content. After whichc you should add/override styles for bigger displays.
* Self Dev
    * To succeed in this, I need consistency, I need to control my what’s in circle of influence [link] habit’s book.
    * Even though I got things done, they weren’t the priority. Therefore I wasn’t as productive as i could've. Have clear goals for the week/day & don’t let other “important” things get in the way. They can be placed in the Todo backlog. **Be Effective not just Efficient.**
* How I Feel about Tools
    * Git is a pretty amazing tool.
    * Github makes collaboration way more fun & social.
