# Daily Log

### Monday
- What i did
  - continued with Node TP: Logging & Debugging, Error Handling
  - Started & Completed FCC Timestamp Micro-service
- What i learnt
  - Logging & Debugging Middleware in express
  - learnt about Environment Variables & nodeâ€™s process .env
    - are variables that determine how your app should run/execute depending on your host environment/device.
    - The act of providing environment variables is referred to as provisioning.
    - When your Node.js process boots up it will automatically provide access to all existing environment variables by creating an env object as property of the process global object
    - You can Set or Override them & provide temporary variables through the console before running the node app eg PORT=999 node app.js
  - Error Handling:
    - let express handle errors by passing in errors to the next()
    - write custom error handlers/middleware.
