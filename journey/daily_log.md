### Monday
- What i did
  - following React TP: Deeper Dive into Components & React Internals
- What i learnt
  - Higher Order Components - HOC: They are used to Wrap Other Components & apply some behavior to them 
  - 2 Approaches to writing HOC
    - creating an actual Component to wrap other components eg. libraries like Redux’s <Provider/>, Radium's <StyleRoot /> etc
    - creating the HOC as a regular Javascript function that returns the wrapped component with the new behaviour/logic eg. Libraries like Redux's connect() & reducThunk()
  - Component Lifecycle methods

### Tuesday
- What i did
  - following React TP: building a real app: the Burger Builder (Basic Version)
- What i learnt
  - when rendering multiple elements they must always have a parent element wrapper, usually a div tag. But you can circumvent this in 2 ways
    - Add elements in an array & return the array. Array of elements don’t need a wrapper.
    - Use a HOC that serves the sole purpose of returning its children. so the HOC serves as the wrapper & not a div element
