  - Higher Order Components - HOC: They are used to Wrap Other Components & apply some behavior to them

    - creating an actual Component to wrap other components eg. libraries like Reduxâ€™s <Provider/>, Radium's <StyleRoot /> etc
    - creating the HOC as a regular Javascript function that returns the wrapped component with the new behaviour/logic eg. Libraries like Redux's connect() & reducThunk()
