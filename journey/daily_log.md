  - You have to place the port in the `MongoClient.connect` definition in order to access routes defined in `MongoClient`. 
  ``` javascript
  mongo.connect(process.env.DATABASE, (err, db) => {
    // ROUTES
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Homepage')
    })
    // PORT
    app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Listening on port 3000" ) );
  });
  ```
  - When Creating a document using `InsertOne()` & itâ€™s family, the newly inserted Document is passed as a parameter(say `result`) to the callback . It can be accessed on the `ops` property of the `result` object. ie `result.ops[0]`
