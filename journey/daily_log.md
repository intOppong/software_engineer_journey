# Daily Log

### Monday
- What i did
  - Completed FCC Lectures on Quality Assurance & Testing with Chai
  - Started FCC lectures on Advanced Node & Express
- What i learnt
  - Chai: is a JavaScript testing (assertion) library that helps you check that your program still behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes.
    - Assertion: is a statement that a predicate (Boolean-valued function, i.e. a true–false expression) is always true at that point in code execution.
  - Mocha: Is a javascript testing framework on nodejs that has a lot of features for testing.
    - by default Mocha looks for a dir called test for files to test.
  - You can place scripts in your `package.json` file & run it from the terminal `npm run <scriptName>`. That's how mocha is mostly run.
  - API Calls are Async. Web interactions are asynchronous !!.
  - A headless browser is a browser without a graphical user interface. useful for testing web pages as they are able to render and understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the same way a browser would. eg Zombie.js for node.js
  - [Unit Testing vs Functional Testing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2741832/unit-tests-vs-functional-tests)
  
    | Unit Testing | Functional Testing |
    | --- | --- |
    | Unit Test - testing an individual unit, such as a method (function) in a class, with all dependencies mocked up. | Functional Test - AKA Integration Test, testing a slice of functionality in a system. This will test many methods and may interact with dependencies like Databases or Web Services. |
    | Unit tests are written from a programmer's perspective. They ensure that a particular method of a class successfully performs a set of specific tasks. Each test confirms that a method produces the expected output when given a known input. | Functional tests are written from a user's perspective. These tests confirm that the system does what users are expecting it to. |
    | Unit tests tell a developer that the code is doing things right | functional tests tell a developer that the code is doing the right things. |
    | Unit test is done first | functional test assumes you already did the Unit test. Now we testing if it the right things were done not just anything regardless if anything was done right. |
  - Passport.js: If the authentication was successful, the user object will be saved in req.user.
- Challenges
  - Don’t fully understand how chai-http works.
  - Don't fully understand how passport flow works. is serialization done before auth? among other thoughts.
