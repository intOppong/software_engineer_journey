# Daily Log

### Monday
- What i did
  - applied for FCC JAMstack hackathon
  - cont learning Promises. YDKJS: Async
  - continued TP
    - Added MongoDB & Mongoose to Project to save user data from oAuth
- What i learnt
  - a beneficial side effect of wrapping Promise.resolve(..) around any function's return value (thenable or not) is that it's an easy way to normalize that function call into a well-behaving async task. If foo(42) returns an immediate value sometimes, or a Promise other times, Promise.resolve( foo(42) ) makes sure it's always a Promise result. And avoiding Zalgo makes for much better code.
  - You shouldn't require mongoose models in multiple files. When running mongoose in a test env (running some mocha test) & require your models in multiple files, your model files will be required into the project multiple times & mongoose assumes you attempting to Load in multiple models of the same name. The solution is to: 
    - Require the model class in the entry file eg index.js. Once required, the model class then loads the schema into mongoose. Hence mongoose is alreadly aware of the model class, so pull the model out of mongoose using `mongoose.model(<modelName>)`

  - It's difficult to understand passport's workflow

### Tuesday
- What i did
  - cont learning Promises. YDKJS: Async
  - continued TP: Development & Production Keys, Generated react app using create-react-app, Coding some React
  - used `concurrently` npm module to start up 2 servers togheter 
- What i learnt
  - Chaining Promises
    - Inside the fulfillment/rejection handlers, if you return a value or an exception is thrown, the new returned (chainable) Promise is resolved accordingly
    - If the fulfillment or rejection handler returns a Promise, it is unwrapped, so that whatever its resolution is will become the resolution of the chained Promise returned from the current then(..)
    - if the rejection handler is omitted, Errors are passed(rethrows the error) on to the next chained promise. error continue propagating along a Promise chain until an explicitly defined rejection handler is encountered.
    - if the fulfillment handler is ommited, it simple passes whatever value it recieves along to the next Promise.
  ``` javascript
    p = Promise.resolve(4);
    p
      .then( function(){

        console.log( "A" );           // runs
        obj.one;                      // Obj is not Defined Error
        console.log('B');             // never gets here
      })
      .then(function(){               // never gets here
          console.log( "B" );
        })
      .then(
        function() {                  // never gets here
          console.log('C');
        },
        function(err) {                 // rejection handler to catch the error
          console.log('ERROR:', err);   // Reference Error: obj is not defined
          return 'ydkjs';               // fulfills/resolves next promise
        }
      )
      .then(
        function(val){
          console.log( val );           // 'ydkjs' - resume operation
        }
      )
   ```
  - create-react-app (CRA) has it's own built-in server for running the client. CRA will bundle together your frontend files & produce static files for production so that the server will not be needed in production.
  - __Routing Stumbling Block:__ since CRA has itâ€™s own server, relative links <a> will be added to the domain of the front-end server not our backend server & this can cause unwanted problems. For example, the sign in (eg `/auth/google`) routes are defined in the backend server & accessing the them from the client server will lead somewhere else since they both have different servers hence domains ie
    - backend domain: http://localhost:5000 -> route: `/auth/google`
    - frontend domain: http//localhost:3000 -> route: `/auth/google`
  - __Solution:__ CRA has a built in proxy that can be configured to forwards requests from the client server to the backend server in development mode. This way you don't have to use absolute links in your html files
