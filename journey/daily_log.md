### Wednesday
- What i did
  - Started & Finished FCC Project: Metric-Imperial Converter
  - Started FCC Project: Issue Tracker
- What i learnt 
  - Writing numbers with `e`: [link](https://javascript.info/number).
  - Anything that can coerced into a number is considered a number by isNaN(). ie the parameter is coerced into a number before isNaN runs. example `isNaN(null) => false` ie null is a number. `isNaN(undefined) => true` ie undefined is not a number
  - [Null vs Undefined](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6604749/what-reason-is-there-to-use-null-instead-of-undefined-in-javascript): Null and undefined are essentially two different values that mean the same thing. My Preference is undefined. Here's Why
    - null is a data type but `typeof null` returns an `object` (this is a bug). This can cause issues in comparison statements.
    - an undefined varialbe (a declared variable without a value) has the value `undefined` by default so why change that.
    - null can be coerced to 0 & cause unexpected results. null = 0, undefined = NaN
  - I think array.forEach() allows you to write your own custom handler to be executed for each array element like JS provides for you with filter(), map(), reduce() 
- Challenges I faced
  - I can't access the api routes in the Issue Tracker Project.
