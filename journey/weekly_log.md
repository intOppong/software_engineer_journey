# Weekly Log

### Overview
- Week 1
  - summary: Mum was sick so I had to go to the shop everyday. But I know I had time in the evenings & early mornings to put in some pomodoro but I didn’t — These are the times  that will determine if i succeed (break in) or not. 
- Week 2
  - I’m at the point where Doing what I have to do especially when I don’t feel like doing it is my only option to break in.
  - summary: week started of like last week ended, but I came out of it stronger & crushed it like I’ve never done before. Thanks to merijn & the realization that I have to do what I have to do to get what I want & that doing what I have to do makes me more happier than otherwise. Even though it sometimes "sucks" that’s life & it is what it is. So stick to happyness (cos it easier) & instead of feeling down & doing it cos it sucks. So since you're going to do it no matter the mood, choose to be happy & do it rather than feeling down & doing it because then it will really suck doing it.

### Week 1
- What I did:
  - Finished a [Tutorial project](https://github.com/intOppong/software_engineer_journey/tree/dev/tutorial_projects/socket-io-chat-app) on socket.io
  - Finished FCC sockets lectures: code working but tests failed.
  - Started doing FCC Information Security & Quality Assurance Projects: Metric-Imperial Converter
- What I Learnt
  - The socket.io process is basically about defining sockets at the server-side & client side to listen & emit data
  - Got introduced to keycodes associated with characters. example: Enter key === 13. [Link](https://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes)
  - passport.socketio: It's a module used to find out who’s connected to your web socket by making the authenticated `req.user` object available on the socket object as `socket.request.user.`
