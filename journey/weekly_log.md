# Weekly Log

### Overview
- I want this. I want to be better

### Week 1
- What i did:
  - did FCC nodejs lectures: Basic Node & Express
  - started FCC MongoDB & Mongoose lectures
  - finished FCC API & Micro-services lectures: MongoDB & Mongoose
  - started Following a Nodejs Tutorial Project to get a feel of how full stack app is built with Nodejs [link]()
  -   Jade view engine, CRUD using simple JSON, Routing & Middleware, working with API
- What I Learnt
  - how to set up MongoDB & Mongoose in a node app
  - Various express route & middleware techniques such as
    - chaining diff http verbs to the same route,
    - getting input from user using the request parameter, query parameter or through the usual post request
    - chaining middlewares / handlers using the next function.
    - the body-parser middleware package
  - CRUD With Mongoose
  - working with Node on local machine. learnt the Jade syntax
  - Template engines: what they are & why they important
  - res.render() in express [add some more] ref to express.js
  - using express.router() to create mini-app instances & access the routing capabilities in our module without having to pass in our main app instance into our modules.
  - postman. API testing tool.
  - What an API is. *been very confusing to me what it really is. is it a Server? etc*
    - An API is just a server that returns to the client side data upon request.
    - API is where the client makes a call to our web server & we return an object (data, methods) & use it to build up an interactive client side app.
    - so the client side don’t have to go to the main server to ask for data, it interacts with the API, & the API interacts with the server. The API acts as the middleman between Client Side & Server Side, & what is does it sending resources/data
- Challenges
  - are middlewares different from handlers.
  - took a while to understand what the done() was for in the fcc mongodb/mongoose challenges. It’s basically our
  error handler.
  - why module.exports is used for the export of functions instead of just exports i.e. What is the difference between Node's module.exports and ES6's export
