	        <h2 >Scott Young</h2>
	        <p>Scott is the one who taught me that you can do/learn anything if you put your mind to it & apply the right methods. He’s taken on several challenges to master skills in diverse areas.
	          He completed MIT’s 4-year undergraduate computer science curriculum in 12 months, without taking any classes. He was successful in passing the final exams for 33 classes and completing
	          the required programming projects. You can view his TEDx Talk regarding the challenge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piSLobJfZ3c" target="_blank">here</a>. He also learnt 4 different
	          languages in a year without speaking English. He also did a 30-day challenge to see how much improvement he could make in drawing faces & did a pretty good job at that too. </p>
